Recumeet is an Android application designed to revolutionize professional networking and mentorship, particularly for students aspiring to either jumpstart or navigate through their career paths. Our platform aids in building and strengthening professional relationships, infusing new opportunities for interaction and discovery. It seamlessly bridges the gaps between job seekers, recruiters, mentors, and fellow professionals.
## The Problem Recumeet is Tackling
In a world saturated with digital interfaces, robust interaction often becomes a dwindling commodity. Recumeet aims to tackle these key issues:
1. **Lack of Interaction:** Students often find it hard to establish one-to-one connections with professionals or experts in their field to gain in-depth knowledge and guidance. Recumeet provides a platform for students to have direct video interactions with professionals, facilitating a better understanding and providing room for clarity and doubt resolutions.
2. **Lack of Networking System:** Networking with top professionals or finding mentors often becomes a challenge for students and aspiring professionals. Recumeet remediates this by providing a robust networking system that connects students with top-notch professionals for guidance, advice, and potential recommendations.
## How Recumeet is Different from Other Platforms?
While other platforms focus mainly on professional networking by allowing job seekers to post their CVs and employers to post jobs, Recumeet provides a much more comprehensive approach:
1. **Recumeet** offers a real-time interactive platform where job seekers can have explicit one-on-one or group discussions with professionals through audio/video channels.
2. Professionals are provided with an opportunity to interact with aspirants, share their experiences and knowledge, and draw meaningful collaborations.
3. Unlike other platforms, Recumeet propels beyond just creating profiles and "connecting". We put real-time video interaction at the forefront, which other platforms often do not provide.
## Features
1. One-to-One and Group Interaction
2. Real-time audio/video channels
3. Robust networking features
4. Seamless mentor-mentee connection
5. Explore new technology and upgrade your skill set

# RecuMeet Code Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to RecuMeet! To maintain a consistent codebase and ensure high-quality contributions, please adhere to the following guidelines when making changes to the project.

## Coding Style

- Use consistent and descriptive variable and function names.
- Follow the Java naming conventions for classes, interfaces, methods, and variables.
- Use camelCase for variable and method names (e.g., `myVariable`, `myMethod()`).
- Avoid using single-letter variable names unless they are used as loop counters.
- Indent code using spaces, not tabs. Use four spaces for each level of indentation.
- Limit line length to 100 characters to improve code readability.

## Comments and Documentation

- Use comments to explain complex or critical sections of code.
- Document public methods and classes using JavaDoc comments, providing clear descriptions of their purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Include inline comments to provide additional context where necessary.

## Error Handling

- Always handle exceptions appropriately. Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions and handle them gracefully.
- Avoid catching generic exceptions like `Exception` unless necessary. Catch specific exception types whenever possible.
- Log error messages using appropriate logging mechanisms (e.g., `Log` for Android applications).

## Testing

- Write comprehensive unit tests for new features and modifications.
- Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Consider adding integration tests for critical functionalities.

## Pull Requests

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix you're working on.
- Keep your pull requests focused and limited to a specific set of changes.
- Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the pull request.
- Ensure that your branch is up to date with the main repository before submitting a pull request.

## Review Process

- Be receptive to feedback during the code review process and be open to making necessary changes.
- Reviewers may request changes to align the code with project standards and best practices.
